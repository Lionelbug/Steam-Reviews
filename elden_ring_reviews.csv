recommende,"Elden Ring is one of the best games I have ever played.  Elden Ring was my first Souls-experience, and my first game by FromSoftware. Before I had even played the game, I was afraid that the game's difficulty would be to much for me. This fear would even carry over for a while into me actively playing the game. I have played my fair share of games, however, I had heard from many that Elden Ring was, in many ways, one of the most difficult games around.  And they were right.  Elden Ring is difficult. Over and over, I died time and time again, struggling against foes of increasing difficulty and power. But each death taught me something. Every time I failed, I would learn. Suddenly, the once impossible boss became possible, the unpredictable moves became more predicable. Nothing in the game itself had changed, I just became better at it.  Elden Ring is about learning. You will struggle at the beginning, and that is [i]the point.[/i] Elden Ring is about both learning the actual enemies, and also how the game itself works. It is about going from it feeling like the game is working against you, to with you.  [u]And that's only the beginning[/u]  I have said nothing about the incredible visuals, design, music, world-building and lore put into this masterpiece, which I believe will stand as a landmark for years to come. The amount of love that has been carefully poured into this world can be felt with every step you take in it.  If you are reading this review, I urge you to consider playing the game, as it is one of the most fun experiences I have had in any game.    As of writing this review, I have beaten the base game 4 times, and the DLC once.  [b]And I don't regret a second of it[/b]",2025-03-30 13:22:39,16512

not recommende,"Another game with the reviews summary saying ""Very Positive"". And my second review this morning saying otherwise. To set some sort of context I like the worlds created by Bethesda Studios - movement & game progress is logical and understandable. I'm on record as having played for 3.4 hrs, and something (or a lot of things) just didn't gel for me. You don't make massive progress in 3.4 hrs, geographically or skills gain. But I just didn't feel any desire to make the effort. In one particular open world game I have 10K+ hrs logged, and view it's heavily modded state as an alternative reality. I can't see that ever happening with Elden Ring, so it's my second write-off this morning.",2025-03-30 12:05:38,202

recommende,"I'm a fan of Souls-borne but Elden Ring is personally too fast for me. I like the open world design, I think that's cool since no other souls-borne game has a true open world.  I feel like this game would be better if you started like DS1, with slower combat and limited stamina and then the gameplay became far more fast later on or just slow until NG+; the attacks for some bosses and enemies are faster then you can blink so it's harder to parry and also roll on time without sacrificing I-frames. It feels far more like a hack and slash as even high level enemies get fatigued with only a couple hits.  Overall I rate it: 7/10, Still a good game but if it was my first souls-borne it would be 9/10",2025-03-30 07:06:43,413

recommende,"I never thought I'd get into the Souls genre and if I'm being honest, I almost quit early on. I kicked my melee build (Confessor) to the curb after 7 hours of frustration, restarted as an Astrologist (Mage) and never looked back!   The scenery in this game is absolutely breathtaking. I lost count how many times I paused for a few seconds just to take it all in. The main boss fights are all very memorable - and not as hard once you get comfortable with the mechanics. There's a flow to it.   I've finished Elden Ring twice now, first on PS5 and more recently on PC. I'm impressed with the quality of the port to Windows. I didn't have any issues with stutter and I was able to crank the graphics all the way to constant 60fps - 4k resolution (without ray tracing) on an RTX2080ti  10/10 would play it again! Definitely worth the hype! Just stick with it - you'll see! Oh, and the internet is your friend: find the Elden Ring wiki online, watch YouTube videos for tips/tricks and help with navigating this epic dark fantasy.   George RR Martin's talent for storytelling is a welcome additional to the gaming industry. I hope they make a movie or TV series of this one day!  [spoiler] Get the Meteorite staff and Rock sling spell early on. Find the 'Rotview Balcony' site of grace and kill those birds from the ledge to farm their runes. Rinse and repeat! You'll level up VERY quickly! You're welcome [/spoiler]",2025-03-30 06:48:16,3719

recommende,"I never thought I'd be a fan of a Souls game at all. But this game showed me the appeal to Souls-likes. The challenging bosses, the relentless hellscape you are placed in, the unforgiving & lack of coddling that people get so used to while playing games. These sound like they should be cons, but they are some of the games strengths in immersing you in an experience that you cannot find elsewhere. An introductory guide would definitely be needed to figure out your bearings in the beginning, but once you figure that out, I believe this game could easily be one of the best you could ever play.   Once you get into the game, do not be discouraged in the difficulty of the bosses you meet in the Lands Between, but keep on going. This game rewards perseverance, so remain persistent and you shall be rewarded.   Don't forget to also explore the magnificent and beautiful world that the Lands Between is.",2025-03-30 05:55:58,10013

I 100% it and explored every or almost every single area + dungeon. A lot of the dungeons and content are copy and paste however. But still enjoyable. This game is extremely polished espically for PC compared to other souls games. It is still recomended to play this with controller as all souls games.  This game is very new player friendly. Other souls games are much harder. There are so many different builds options which offers a lot of variety. I had a lot of fun with this game.

not recommende,"Co-op is excellent, especially with ERSC. Solo, I can't stand it. I just hate this game. [i]Elden Ring[/i] has to be the most overrated game in human history, and with 250 hours of trying to love this game, trying over and over to sink my teeth into this game to just eek out [i]one[/i] solo victory, I just can't. I absolutely hate it. It's tied with [i]Dark Souls 3[/i] for being far and away the worst [i]From[/i] title, and the only reason I even got as far as I did in this game was co-opping it. (Spare me your get goods though; I soloed the twin tigers and their reindeer hellscape in [i]Dark Souls 2[/i]) The hitstun in this game is insane barring wearing stupid fat armor, so bad it gives me Kingdom: [i]Hearts Birth By Sleep[/i] flashbacks. This game is not an adventure, it's the digital equivalent of Chinese water torture. How much can you take before you lose it and we can all laugh at you and say ""Lol, git gud."" It also loves throwing total ganks at you, which sometimes you can draw out, but most times they're scripted to just surround you with tiny twink enemies that stun you and bleed you to death before you can really get a single input off. The damage everything does in this game is overclocked and unless you absolutely soak your HP stat and the ONE SINGLE DAMAGE STAT OF YOUR CHOOSING, you will do no damage and you will die to everything in a hit or two. And even if not, the combos, ranged options that every enemy has, and AOEs that every enemy also seems to have, will be sure to finish you off. Even the remotely good bosses shit it up with some sudden low-broadcast AOE that hits you even if you roll because of their lingering shitboxes. Crucible Knight, Tree Sentinel, both workable bosses, that can also just AOE shit on you at the drop of a hat. Basic fodder knights can strike you with lightning or throw tornadoes at you, all while you sit there like a pathetic little DS1 character while they're playing Sekiro. There is no sense of accomplishment in this game. Everything in it is a brick wall, from repeating bosses to overtuned gauntlets that you're better off just no engaging with and trying to bullshit your way past them quickly. And what awaits you on the other side? More of the same. Barely any of the treasure or weapons are worth it in this game. All the cool shit you'll be seeing others do is lategame after they've sunk triple digit levels into your build, and probably wasted millions more on all the upgrade stones that are the most annoying upgrade system yet. Why are there more smithing 3s than 4s in the game? Why must I be stuck at +6 forever? Good luck leveling up fast, by the way. You can beat bosses on tier and they won't give you enough for a level up. Of my 250 hours in this game, more than half of that was in co-op and in solo, I think I enjoyed less than 5 hours with this game. If you must play it, do it in ERSC with friends, because if not, it's thoroughly unenjoyable. Every co-op run I do tricks me into thinking this game is actually fun. Every solo one elucidates me that no, it's not fun. It's not designed around one player. But then again, most spirit ashes suck too, so I'll never understand their philosophy behind this game. I just have to assume it's a big joke courtesy of [i]From[/i] and the [i]Souls[/i] series elitists, and I am the punchline. I'd rather be at my job than playing this solo.",2025-03-30 00:44:56,15049
not recommende,"Yes i have over 200 Hours. I also will continue to play. But i cannot wholeheardetly give it a thumbs up because of the attrocious lategame balancing and just generally extremely hostile gamedesign.  More than half the bosses heavily tip the balance to being so frustrating that instead of feeling accomplishment after beating them, you just feel relieved that you finally are done with it. Winning often feels more like getting lucky than having earned the victory.  Bosses input reading your actions just to punish you and timing their attacks precisely to stunlock and rollcatch you regulary pulls you out of the game and breaks immersion. At the same time their attack animations are so stupid and obscure that they are not readable anymore like in the other games, devolving the gameplay into trial and error. In a game which is otherwise a complete triumph on creating a world to be explored and marveled, enemy design is literally rotting the game from the core.  When you get somewhat close to the end they are literally shoving multiple former bosses as regular enemys together, with more health and WAY more damage than they originally had, just to make a ""difficult"" encounter. Regular enemys are so tanky they take up to a minute to kill and often appear in groups, at the same time they kill you in three hits.  FromSoft refuses to adress issues like dodge on button-release, which is just horrible when telegraphing of incoming damage is in the realm of 250ms, requiring more precise dodging than every before.  Im writing this at a point where im again in the lategame with a new character. I never finished the game and it is precisely because the lategame isnt fun anymore, its extremely depressing and frustrating. Frustrating because of the above and alot more which i dont have the patience to type out.  Depressing because this game is barely a RPG anymore. Why do i say that? Because if you turn to the lategame/endgame and have difficulty with something, the advice devolves into the following options: Cheese with consumables, dual wield axes and jump attack, use bleed, use spirit ashes. Wanna do a poison build? nope, poison is useless in this game. Wanna do black flame build? Nope, many bosses literally dodge all thrown incantations and the others are weak af, just use Burn O Flame silly. Except when the boss is too fast and input reads all attempts. Basically, either you use one of the things FromSoft says its endgame viable, or you literally have like 5~10 times the difficulty. Specializing and thus living out a build fantasy is not possible unless youre extremely good at the game and like to play hardmode. There are a billion incantations, spells and skills in the game and 95% are ruined because FromSoft doesnt know how to balance stuff to work throughout the game.  Even tho it doesnt make a difference and it hurts, im going to vote with my wallet and miss out on the DLC and not support this kind of design anymore.",2025-03-30 00:44:23,13882

not recommende,"The bosses are absurdly hard to kill.  I mean, to the brink of me giving up altogether.  It is maddening to have to go after a boss 10 times only to ""get a lucky shot"" on the 11th.  This doesn't happen once or twice, but over and over and over.  I play offline, so maybe its easier in multiplayer mode.  Anyway, I installed some mods (from Nexus mods) that made the game unbalanced, but a little more enjoyable.  And, Smithbox is not too difficult to master.  If Bandi Namco doesn't create an offline version, with scaling bosses, I won't ever buy one of their games again.  It would be easy to make them, say, 10 levels higher than the player.  Based on online reviews, I definitely won't be buying Dark Souls either.  Suggestion for BN too.  Make auto-saves.  This business of going way back to the the last Grace Point on death is disheartening and dumb (IMO).",2025-03-29 17:26:59,15391

recommende,"[h1][b]Elden Ring - Where Beauty Meets Brutality (and My Pride Gets Repeatedly Punched)[/b][/h1]  Oh, Elden Ring. What a masterpiece you are! FromSoftware has truly outdone themselves with this one—like they handed Picasso a game engine and said, ""Make something that'll make people cry."" And boy, does it make you cry rivers.  The graphics? [b]Stunning.[/b] Seriously, I’ve spent more time staring at the sunset over Limgrave than actually playing the game. The landscapes are so breathtakingly beautiful that every time I respawn after dying to some random frog or pot-wielding grandma, I feel like I’m in an art gallery where someone keeps punching me in the face. It’s poetic. Truly poetic.  And the gameplay? Stellar. The combat system is tight, responsive, and deeply satisfying when you finally nail that perfect parry against a giant knight who's been curb-stomping you for hours. Every victory feels earned, even if it took me 47 tries to beat a tree stump that might have been sentient. There’s just something magical about going from “I hate everything” to “I am the Elden Lord!” in under five seconds.  Now let’s talk about the difficulty. Oh, sweet merciful heavens, this game is brutal. But here’s the twist—it’s fun! Like, really fun. Sure, I’ve screamed at my screen more times than I can count because yet another invisible skeleton decided to ruin my day, but there’s always this little voice inside me saying, “Come on, you got this!” [i]Spoiler alert: I didn’t get this.[/i] Not most of the time anyway. But hey, dying is half the experience, right? [i]Right?![/i]  In conclusion, Elden Ring is a love letter to gamers who enjoy being humbled by their own incompetence while marveling at jaw-dropping visuals and flawless mechanics. If you’re looking for a challenge that’ll test your patience, skill, and will to live, look no further. Just be prepared to lose a few hundred hours of your life—and possibly your sanity—to a video game that somehow makes failure feel rewarding.",2025-03-29 12:05:25,1726

recommende,"Hard but fun, don't let anyone tell you how to play, the most fun way is to choose. Play with spirits, summons, whatever, it's what makes the game unique",2025-03-29 06:30:10,13945
recommende,"Overall the first play through of the game will be your most significant and important.  The game is more artificially long due to having to go out of your way longer distances for materials.  While the open world is well set up almost like a maze of a height map which is very cool, that does not excuse the fact that you will have to spend more time travelling on every run.  If you're someone who likes to make multiple characters and builds similar to myself you'll probably not play it as much.  I also enjoy co-oping with randoms and that's still more hassling to do in an open world game as well.  Fromsoft's habit of always doing things the same way and using their dated multiplayer systems of summon signs likely costed them some players in this game, as this old system is generally more annoying for everyone, not to mention fogwalls and not being able to ride your horse in multiplayer.  Something modders were able to fix with very little trouble.  So now lets talk about balance, since Elden Ring is actually the most inspired by Dark Souls 2 due to the fact that DS2 was meant to be an open world game but wasn't due to engine limitations, and that DS2 had a lot of busted magic and spell blade builds, and power stancing similar weapon types, this reflects itself onto Elden Ring quite strongly.  This is a fun game but it is in no way balanced, it is meant to be very fun and wild just like DS2.  So due to the aforementioned reasons I give this game a solid 8/10.",2025-03-29 06:29:17,25462

recommende,"It's like Breath of the Wild, but actually challenging.  It favors people who don't mind grinding for levels or retrying a fight multiple times.  There is disappointment when your character dies.  BUT, there is also a real sense of achievement with this game.  I can finally beat some early bosses after, like, 30 hours, and it feels great.  Elden Ring is one of the few games that had me running for my life, literally screaming at the computer monitor.  The monster design is excellent (and often gross).  I also enjoy how the story is mysterious and hidden all over the place.  A lot of it is up to the player to form their own conclusions.  It feels like you've been dropped in after the apocalypse, and now you have to deal with the fallout.    Lastly, this is probably sacrilegious, but I recommend playing with controller, even on PC.  I grew up with consoles, and I was having a really hard time with the mouse/keyboard controls.  The controller can be a little less convenient due to fewer buttons, but for me, it made it much easier to get dodge timing down.  And dodging is really, REALLY important.",2025-03-29 06:14:19,3190

recommende,"A great open-world game with souls mechanics and a deep lore with many ways to play the game and few permanent missables. This review encompasses my experience using the sorcery build and I followed a rough guideline that would let me enjoy the game best. This also entails a platinum run without the DLC.   Disclaimer: yeah that's right I used the sorcery build. That's just my playstyle idgaf if people say it's easier. I did use carian slicer a lot as my main spell and I even beaten some bosses using only carian slicer like Radagon, Malenia, Radahn. I also did use summons like mimic and tiche. Why wouldn't I use smth that's built into the game? And knowing my personality and how I play games, I followed a ROUGH guideline to tell me the best way to approach certain areas: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2785187510. Oh and I used a backup saves for the endings bc yeah shut up.   And people who are being souls supremacists, it's just a game. Why you gatekeeping people tryna enjoy a game? Play however you'd like and this is how I played it.   Pros:  - deep lore with very fascinating details. There's so much content to do in the world. Even with NG+ there's a lot to do but beyond that, it's just self-proclaimed challenge runs.  - gameplay mechanics as a souls like is much smoother than expected. Even difficult bosses offer a glimmer of hope when you learn their attack patterns.  - played with controller, works seamlessly with controller.  - visuals and PC optimization was surprisingly very well done. Probably bc the game was locked at 60 fps.  - many mechanics are forgivable and non-permanent. Many larval tears are offered throughout the game and excess upgrade materials for weapons you realize you don't like upon upgrading.  - achievements are based on defeating special bosses and collecting the legendary items in the map. More forgiveable than collecting all items in the game or smth like that found in other games.  - music and sfx are immersive. cutscenes are a little lackluster and I wish there were more.   Cons:  - a lot of the lore is embedded into items scattered around the world. So I read up on the lore and watched lore vids a fair bit.  - the open world concept and hidden secrets found in the map can be a bad thing. It's too overwhelming for some people and even moreso when you consider hidden walls or invisible paths.  - catacombs and caves got repetitive really fast... some of the bosses are reused too.   A really fun game that goes on sale fairly common. However it's a huge timesink if you want to explore all of what the game has to offer. It's a hard game but even things that become challenging, you'll reach a moment where things click and you just read the boss perfectly and you're patient and then it becomes a joy.",2025-03-29 04:00:12,5567
